# ml-prototypes-feedback-collector

This project is designed to create a tool for interactive user participation in the interpretation of results generated by machine learning systems, with a particular focus on visual classification. The aim is to enable users to verify and provide feedback on the accuracy of object identification and classification in images by the machine learning model. 

Model we are using
https://github.com/cfchen-duke/ProtoPNet

## How to Run with Docker

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.
You can get docker from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
Download [model](https://github.com/cfchen-duke/ProtoPNet) and [dataset](https://data.caltech.edu/records/65de6-vp158). 
Place dataset inside ProtoPNet directory.
Place ProtoPNet package and dataset inside project directory.

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the Repository.
2. Navigate inside repository package.
3. Build the Docker Image  
```sh
docker build -t visual-classification-feedback-system .
```
4. Run the Docker Container 
```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 27017:27017 visual-classification-feedback-system
```
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the Visual Classification Feedback System.

### Stopping the Docker Container

To stop the running container, use the following command: 
`docker ps`

Find the container ID and then stop it using:
`docker stop <container_id>`

### Additional Docker Commands
- **List all containers:** `docker ps -a`
- **Remove a container:**`docker rm <container_id>`
- **Remove an image:**    `docker rmi <image_id>`
